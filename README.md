# Open Categories

An open categorization system for platforms that handle information about food, fashion, technology and others

## Important: We need collaboration with the inclusion of new categories
See categories.yaml to see the different categories we support for now.

This is still a work in progress.

## Collaboration

- Clone this repo, and start adding your code in the `index.ts` file, or adding categories / translations in `categories.yaml`
- When you are done, write the tests in the `index.test.ts` file. For testing, this repo works with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

## Dev Features
* Testing with Jest
* Linting out of the box (checks the style of your code), with TSLint
* Build, prepublish and other scripts to help you to develop
* Works with Typescript: Static typing for your JS Applications, reducing amount of runtime errors
* Coverage out of the box, thanks to Jest
* Uses deterministic module resolving, with Yarn
